<h3>My Biography</h3>

<p> I really enjoyed my life when I was a kid. I remember getting consecutive videos for five years. When I am on my free time, I watch videos and enjoy the fun and games. </p> I live with my parents and my younger brother James. I enjoy drawing, watching television and movies, and playing games on my computer. I do not own any pets by the way.</p>
 <p> Watching those videos made me think what I wanted to do with my hobbies. So, I felt like singing and vocals. I loved to do theatre and perform in plays.</p>


<h3>üé•Technology</h3>

<p> On a daily basis, I just jump on the couch and play on my phone. While my phone is not in use, I use my iPad and watch films on the TV app. Occasionally, I would mostly watch videos on Youtube or WWE Network. </p>
